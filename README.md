## Notebook Breakdown:

- [pyaqs.py](pyaqs.py): This is a custom module that handles wrapping and querying of the EPA Air Quality System API for ease of use with Python and Pandas.
- [data](./data/): This folder contains additional CSV and Excel files with data on instances and deaths from chronic lung disease and cancer.
- [cleaned_data](./cleaned_data/): This folder contains cleaned data files suitable for use in analysis.
- [cleaning_data.ipynb](cleaning_data.ipynb): This interactive notebook handles cleaning and preparation of the data.
- [data_analysis.ipynb](data_analysis.ipynb): This interactive technical notebook handles the analysis of prepared data, including automated hypothesis testing and visualizations.
- [visualizations_and_conclusions.ipynb](visualizations_and_conclusions.ipynb): This interactive notebook aimed at a non-technical audience contains visualizations and conclusions from our data analysis.
- [slides.pdf](slides.pdf): This slide deck contains a presentation on the material and results gathered here.
- [non_technical_notebook.ipynb](non_technical_notebook.ipynb): This is a non-technical notebook that gives a high-level overview of our project and again goes over visuualizations and conclusions.
